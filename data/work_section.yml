# How we work list section
how_we_work:
  - title: Deep requirements understanding
    desc: With strong medical and scientific
          background and a sharp analytic eye, we
          understand health data projects to the
          finest of details.
  - title: Fast and openiteration cycles
    desc: Aggressive approach to development,
          prioritizing complete process transparency
          and fast iterations to converge ideas and
          requirements early.
  - title: Battle-test implementation
    desc: Deployment to sandboxed real-world
          environments and deep scrutiny of software
          performance under pressure scenarios.
  - title: Inspection & improvement
    desc: Deployment to sandboxed real-world
          environments and deep scrutiny of software
          performance under pressure scenarios.
  - title: Deliver Robust Technology
    desc: Adoption by ourselves and by our partners to
          supercharge scientific data processes,
          maximizing operational efficiency, and
          minimizing scaling cost.
